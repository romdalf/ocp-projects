# Multi Cluster Application Interconnect

## a hybrid cloud story

This demo is leveraging the [skupper example hello world](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-hello-world) demo to showcase the journey from a development enviroment to a hybrid-cloud deployment. During the walkthrough, the following concepts will be explored:

- how to build a secure container image? or how to include security at the early stage for a frictionless production-grade deployment
- how to deploy applications in a PaaS or even CaaS approach? or how to release in full "gated" autonomy
- how to support split front-end/back-end architecture? or how to leverage the cloud to deploy applications within data sovereignty environment

## requirements

This demo has been prepared for Kubernetes in general, and tested on Red Hat OpenShift for a customers and partners event using the followings: 

- [Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) running on a laptop and defined as the on-prem instance
- [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/products/openshift/#overview) - a Microsoft/Red Hat managed OpenShift cluster
- [Skupper](https://skupper.io/) - a multi cloud communication framework for Kubernetes  

However, since OpenShift is a certified Kubernetes distribution, the overall walkthrough should work on any Kubernetes flavor. To that extend, despite using the ```oc``` command, all parameters and arguments have been set to be compatible with ```kubectl```. 

???+ note

    Skupper has been selected in this context to provide a granular connectivity between the front-end and back-end across a secure network.  
    Another solution would be to use Submariner if unifying two cluster at a network level from a scope perspective.

    why using these tags?   
    why is this message appearing?

### accessing the application 

Opening http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a browser should provide a web page with a button "Say Hello" and responsding with the back-end pod name. If the page is refresh, the autogenerated name will be updated and sent to the backend too.

## split deployment

To ease the compliance audit related to our market regulation, our back-end supporting our customer data will be hosted on-prem. 

In this scenario, we would consider the followings:

- the OpenShift Local as an on-prem environement called "south"
- the Azure Red Hat OpenShift as our cloud environement called "north"

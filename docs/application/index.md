This subsection provides an overview to build, deploy, and maintain an application with a learning curve from a source to image up to practices like CI/CD, GitOps, and more.

The Git repository is structure as follow:

```
docs/
  images/
  sources/
    gitops/        
      dev/         
      prd/
      tst/
```

Each folders within the ```gitops``` folder can be added in ArgoCD to deploy the examples. More details to come.
